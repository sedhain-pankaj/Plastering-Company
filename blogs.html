          <h1>Plaster Moulding Corbels for Victorian Hallways</h1>
  
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:20px;">
          There is an undeniable charm to Victoriana that still holds people spellbound to this very day. This type of architecture
           is highly sought-after, and plaster reproductions, restorations, and Victoriana-themed aesthetics abound everywhere. One 
           of the most well-known features architecture is the usage of plaster moulding corbels in Victorian hallways.<br><br>

          While this practice dates back to ancient times, with examples that can be found all over the world, it is most well-known at
           least in modern times for featuring strongly in Victorian architecture.<br><br>

          <b>What are Corbels?</b><br>
          Corbels are supplementary structural additions made of stone, wood, metal, or plaster that jut out of a wall. They were originally 
          intended to carry superincumbent weight and to provide additional bolstering to prevent parapets, balconies and other overhanging
           structures from collapsing. It also helped to reinforce the overall structure and create even weight distribution of weight for 
           added safety.<br><br>

          The name ‘corbel’ derives from the Latin corbellus, which is the diminutive of another Latin word – corvus – which meant ‘raven’.
           This was due to the distinctive beak-liked appearance of older corbels. This aesthetic feature eventually changed though, and
            corbels began to feature more ornate designs, often Corinthian in appearance.<br><br>

          Eventually, corbels lost their functional purpose and were relegated to the mere decorative role, especially indoors.<br><br>

          <strong>Benefits of Plaster Corbels</strong><br>
          Eventually, corbels stopped being made from durable and dense materials like stone or metal, and began to be made from soft wood
           or plaster. These were affixed to hallways and acted as mouldings more than practical supports for an overhanging structure. 
           Nevertheless, some plaster corbels were reinforced, often being made of carved hardwood which was later coated with a thick 
           layer of plaster of Paris and then tooled or moulded with the desired aesthetic look.<br><br>

          Plaster corbels, though employed predominantly for aesthetic purposes, offered the following benefits:<br><br>
          • Provided minor support for overhanging light fixtures or corner mouldings – in spite of their now lighter weight
           and less hardy nature, some plaster corbels still functioned like outdoor ones in that they supported light fixtures
            or complimentary carvings.<br><br>

          • Creates the illusion of space – corbels also functioned as something of a ‘trick’ to convince the eye that the ceiling
           of a hallway was taller or wider than it appeared. This wasn’t always properly accomplished though, resulting in the stuffy
            sort of feeling that is common to a number of Victorian hallways.<br><br>

          • A mark of status – only the richest could afford custom-moulded or carved indoor corbels, and thus they became something
           of a status symbol. Today, many plaster corbels are made from pre-moulded material that is not only cheap, but also easily
            installed even by DIY enthusiasts.<br><br>

          <h1>What are Dado Plaster Mouldings?</h1>
  
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:20px;">
              Dado plaster moulding, also known as chair rail moulding, is different from plaster mouldings
              that are used where walls meet ceilings, instead, it is considered a type of wall trim that is
              designed to prevent chairs from making contact and damaging walls. Decoratively attached horizontally
              around the perimeter of rooms, dado mouldings earned the term “chair rails” from the old practice by
              Shakers who developed the tradition of hanging chairs and other furniture on the walls. This was done
              by placing wood pegs and panels shoulder height along walls, so that they could clean the floors
              underneath.<br><br> As the practice of hanging chairs and other furniture on the walls so that the floors could
              be easily cleaned became popular, wall panels were designed and used to divide walls into stylish
              proportions (typically into one-third sections). Dado mouldings are a great way to add a decorative
              element to a room, and as an effective means to protect walls from wear in areas of high traffic and
              where furniture is moved often. Considered a trim that extends from flooring up to approximately 
              one-third of the wall, dado mouldings are commonly used in banquet rooms, dining areas, kitchens,
              foyers, and dining rooms.<br><br> For more information about dado mouldings, or any other type of moulding,

          <h1>Mistakes You Should Avoid During DIY Repairs of Plaster Cornices</h1>
  
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:20px;">
              If you are looking to repair a plaster cornice by yourself, then there are some important things to keep in mind, such as:<br><br>

              • Retain a mould of the original – if you have a piece that is too broken down to be patched up, but it has a duplicate piece,
               retain a moulding of the duplicate. In the absence thereof, the original, no matter how broken down it is, will help in the
                later remodelling of your cornice.<br><br>
              
              • Invest in high-quality plaster – always invest in high-quality plaster. While you may think you are saving money by purchasing
               cheap plaster, it will only do yourself more harm than good. That is because cheap plaster easily breaks down and may contain
                impurities that will make the casting or moulding very difficult.<br><br>
              
              • Do not replace antique plaster with modern alternatives – it cannot be stressed enough that if you have antique plasterwork, 
              always endeavour to restore it or have a professional do it for you. Never replace antique plaster with modern alternatives in
               the hopes that it will ‘look fine’. Chances are, it will look off, and you will have wasted an investment.<br><br>
              
              • Don’t remove details in your plaster – no matter how ‘beyond repair’ a plaster piece is, avoid the urge to remove or chip away
               at details in the plasterwork. Any extant details can go a long way to help in its restoration.<br><br>
              
              If you find that DIY-ing is difficult because of the date, intricacy, or the overall state of your plaster cornice, seek professional
               help from Hopkins Plaster Studio.

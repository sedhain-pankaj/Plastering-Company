## How to Run the Project

This project is built with PHP and HTML, so you will need a local server like Apache to run it. You can use XAMPP, which includes Apache and other useful services like MySQL and PHPMyAdmin.

Here are the steps to run the project using XAMPP:

1. Download and install XAMPP from the official website: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
2. Copy the project files into the `htdocs` folder in your XAMPP installation directory.
3. Open the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache service.
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your_project_folder` to view the website.

Please note that if you want to use the login system or any other feature that requires a database, you will also need to set up a MySQL database using PHPMyAdmin or another tool. The database configuration details should be updated in the relevant PHP files.
